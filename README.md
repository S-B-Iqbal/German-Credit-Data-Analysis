# German-Credit-Data-Analysis

## Objective

The objective is to build a model that classifies whether a Transaction is fraudulent or not.


This file contains the workflow for **Usecase # 2 - Fraud or Not** . The current Jupyter Notebook highlights the following:

## Background

The Dataset holds about a 1000 credit card transactions of users along with labels.

## Data Source

The Data Source for the current project is taken from the **Kaggle** repository with the following [Link](â€‹https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/german-credit)

The original Dataset was missing the **default** column. I have added the column from the original UCI Repository.
